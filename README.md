# Balance
This is code I wrote to solve a family riddle my grandpa has.
I had already solved the riddle before writing the code so don't think I wrote this to cheat

*****NOTE*****
DO NOT RUN CODE IF YOU HAVEN'T SOLVED THE RIDDLE YET AS THAT WOULD RUIN THE WHOLE POINT OF THE RIDDLE
MY MOM HAS BEEN WORKING ON IT SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD SO DON'T CHEAT THAT WOULD BE RUDE

RIDDLE:
A merchant has a balance and four weights. These weights can be used to balance anything between 1-40 pounds.
You can put a weight on either side.
EG. Two weights of 5 and 2 can be used to calculate 3 by putting the weight of 2 with the 3 and balancing it with 5.

More background:
I mostly wrote this in order to show my grandpa what I've learned in college about coding. He is a chemist and a very smart man.
I've been thinking of better ways to solve the problem, as I couldn't think of a better way besides hard-coding every possible 
way to balance the weights. 

I'm thinking of maybe calling a recursive function to add or subtrat weights from the number given.
I also think that this code could be used to find more weight combinations with bigger numbers, which is why I would like to 
create a recursive function later instead of hard-coding every possibility.
